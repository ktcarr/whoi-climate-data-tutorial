    "#### Motivation\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how models are used to assess climate change, or literally, a \"change in climate\". Why do we need models? One reason is that changes in climate, or the \"background state\" of the system, are often smaller than the internal variability of the system, meaning we need lots of samples – more than we have from observations – to estimate it accurately. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, imagine the daily weather in Woods Hole is sampled from a probability distribution (e.g., 30% chance of rain, 70% chance of sun). Then the mean of this distribution (averaged over 30 years, for example) is the climate in Woods Hole, and the spread in this distribution (quantified by the standard deviation, for example) reflects natural variability. Climate *change*, in this example, corresponds to a shift in the mean of the probability distribution. Detecting a shift in the mean is harder if (i) the spread in the distribution is large compared to the shift or (ii) if we have a limited number of samples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations from models increase the number of samples we can use to estimate the mean (and changes to the mean over time). Models also allow us to conduct \"controlled\" experiments, where, for example, we compare simulations with and without greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, the simulation without greenhouse gas emissions is the \"control\", which we're using as a baseline for comparison to the simulation *with* greenhouse gas emissions (the \"experimental\" simulation). One commonly used baseline is the \"pre-industrial control\", in which emission levels are fixed to pre-industrial levels and the model is run for a long time ($\\sim1,000$ years).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outline for this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate these concepts, we'll look at a synthetic example, using a stochastic \"climate model\", where we know the \"true\" level of warming. We'll look at two ways of estimating climate and changes to it:\n",
    "1. averaging over a large ensemble of \"short\" simulations\n",
    "2. randomly sampling from a long pre-industrial control simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll simulate an artificial climate under two scenarios: a pre-industrial scenario and a warming scenario. For each scenario, we'll run lots of simulations, generating an ensemble. Averaging over the ensemble members at each time gives us an estimate of the mean state (the climate) and the natural variability in the system. Comparing the ensemble mean between the control and warming scenarios gives us an estimate of how much the climate has changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll estimate the control climate using a single (longer) pre-industrial control simulation. Because the climate in the control simulation is – by construction – not changing, we can estimate the climate by averaging over time, rather than over ensemble members. We'll show that the estimate for the pre-industrial climate using this approach is similar to that obtained from the ensemble approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "[__Your task:__ assessing climate change using CMIP data.](#To-do:-assess-climate-change-using-CMIP-data) After going through this synthetic example, you'll assess climate change for your own climate index by comparing it between the \"pre-industrial control\" and \"historical\" scenarios of a chosen climate model."

    "Below is the implementation of the stochastic \"climate model\" (you shouldn't need to modify anything in this section to run the code below). For reference, we're numerically solving a version of Equation 3.6 from Frankignoul & Hasselmann (1977). We've decreased the damping rate compared to the paper for illustration purposes. In the paper, the authors are applying this equation to a different problem (the evolution of SST anomalies in the extratropics); here, we're repurposing it to describe climate variability on longer timescales.\n",

To do this, you'll compare the index between a pre-industrial control simulation and historical simulation, both from the CMIP model you validated in the last step of the tutorial. In more detail, one possible approach is:\n",

Then create a \"baseline\" histogram for your index by randomly sampling $n$-year segments from the PI control simulation and computing the mean over each sample.\n",
